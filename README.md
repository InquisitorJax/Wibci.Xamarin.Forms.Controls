# Wibci.Xamarin.Forms.Controls
some common user controls for Xamarin Forms
Note: I'm no longer adding custom controls to this repo - the latest controls can be found here <https://github.com/InquisitorJax/Xamarin-Forms-Controls>

## GridView
Templated Tile Layout rendered against a bound ItemsSource
ItemTappedCommand for MVVM command pattern

NOTE: Not intended for a list of more than 20 or so items. Elements are not cached and recycled like in a ListView
